= Deleting the KubeVirt HyperConverged custom resource

To uninstall {CNVProductName}, you must first delete the
*Container-native virtualization Operator Deployment* custom resource.

.Prerequisites

* An active *Container-native virtualization Operator Deployment* custom resource

.Procedure

. From the {product-title} web console, select `openshift-cnv` from
the *Projects* list.

. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.

. Click *Container-native virtualization Operator*.

. Click the *Container-native virtualization Operator Deployment* tab.

. Click the Options menu {kebab} in the row containing the *hyperconverged-cluster*
custom resource. In the expanded menu, click *Delete HyperConverged*.

. Click *Delete* in the confirmation window.

. Navigate to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page to verify that only the Operator
Pods are running.

. Open a terminal window and clean up the remaining KubeVirt resources by running
the following command:
+
----
$ oc delete apiservices v1alpha3.subresources.kubevirt.io -n openshift-cnv
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Because some KubeVirt resources are currently improperly retained, you must
manually remove them. These resources will be removed automatically after
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712429[*BZ1712429*]) is
resolved.
