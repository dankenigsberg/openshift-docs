= Subscribing to the KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator catalog

Before you install {CNVProductName}, subscribe to the
*KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator* catalog from
the {product-title} web console. Subscribing gives the `openshift-cnv`
namespace access to the {CNVProductName} Operators.

.Prerequisites

* Create a namespace that is named `openshift-cnv`.

.Procedure

.. Select *A specific namespace on the cluster* from the *Installation Mode*
list and choose the `openshift-cnv` namespace.
+
[WARNING]
====
* *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default
`openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces
in the cluster. This option is not supported for use with {CNVProductName}.
You must only install the Operator in the `openshift-cnv` namespace.
* *A specific namespace on the cluster* is what you must select.
The Operator will only watch and be
made available for use in the `openshift-cnv` namespace.
====

is selected.
